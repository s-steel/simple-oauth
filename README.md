Build a simple Rails app, and implement GitHub OmniAuth to authenticate a user to view a list of their public repos and a separate list of their private repos.

Screen shots of a user visiting the welcome page, clicking the link to log in and being redirected to Github to log in, and then being redirected to the users dashboard that shows all their repositories.
